# imdb_search_6200

## How to run the codes
1. You need to have the ElasticSearch running at backend
2. sendDatalToElastic.py is used to index data to ElasticSearch. I did not include data in this repo
3. run `python3 app.py` to have the local flask web server running
4. Open a browser and go to localhost:5000 to make use of the application
